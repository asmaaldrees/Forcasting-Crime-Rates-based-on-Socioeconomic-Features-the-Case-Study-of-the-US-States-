Step 1: Install Anaconda Navigator on your PC (according to your OS)

Step 2: Open Jupyter Notebook and choose the best browser

Step 3: Open the ipynb files one by one

1: Data Prepare for Social Features.ipynb

2: GEO - PLOT.ipynb

3: Regression Algorithms.ipynb

Note: Make sure they are in the same folders where you are reading relevant datasets

Step 4: Open Anaconda Prompt and install the following libraries

pip install plotly

pip install altair

pip install glob

Once they are installed.

Step 5: Move to the ipynb files on your browsers and choose Cell on the bar. There, select Run All.


It will run smoothly and give all the outputs. 

Note: If in case there is any error while running the code 

There could be the following Solutions.

If the error is related to a package or library "pip install name," that library in anaconda prompt

If a plot is not shown on your browser, it will be saved in the directory so you can see it from there.


In an alternative way:

1. Open Google Drive and Upload all your datasets and ipynb files there 
2. Open ipynb files in Google Colab
3. Connect your python Google Colab scripts to Google Drive by adding extra lines of code at the start 
4. Once connected, make sure to give the correct paths to the datasets
5. If any library is unavailable, "! pip install name" is in the same script. 


Note: However, the user is expected to have basic knowledge of the Computer, Google Drives, and Programming software like Anaconda Navigator.
